# League Manager

The purpose of this app is to help managing leagues built on top of SportsPress Wordpress component. Unfortunately, this component is quite complex and doesn't allow to create many games effortlessly.

The app will be developed using React + Redux + Wordpress REST API for web and React Native will be used to create a mobile app.

I'm not going to use eZ Platform as I don't have any sufficient web server to handle it.

## DSP2017 Competition

The app takes part in the DSP2017 competition. It would be great to win any prizes, but the greatest win will be finishing the app I have in mind for a long time and to write at least 2 blog posts per week on my blog: [http://blog.piotrnalepa.pl](http://blog.piotrnalepa.pl)
